SteamID-Lookup
==============

SteamID->IP Lookup made in Python

This is obviously not new, the method has been used since as long as I've been on steam(2007), 
and there is a php version (gag) that rarely finds IPs. So, I took the initiative of creating my own in Python,
which has a much higher find rate than its php counterpart.
