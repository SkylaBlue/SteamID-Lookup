SteamID-Lookup
==============

SteamID->IP Lookup made in Python

This is obviously not new, the method has been used since as long as I've been on steam(2007), 
and there is a php version (gag) that rarely finds IPs. Despite it's long history, not many people know about this method,which is interesting.
I took the initiative of creating my own version of the steam resolver in Python, which has a much higher find rate than its php counterpart.
